# The Problem #

You're developing an application. You need to run this application on your development machine. You need to run it in your Continuous Integration environment (you do do CI right?). You need to run it in UAT, Staging, Performance and maybe even Production. How do you manage the configuration for your application in all these environments?

# The Solution #

This application exists to help in the development and operation of your applications. It is designed to serve environment-specific configuration to a variety of applications in a multitude of environments in a platform agnostic way - as a RESTful HTTP service.

It is particularly useful if your Software Development Lifecycle uses a 'build pipeline' for the promotion of code into production, but this is not a prerequisite.

# ESCAPE Serves Configuration Across Plentiful Environments #

  * **Define** your environments;
  * **Configure** your software;
  * **Own** your configuration;
  * **Encrypt** your assets;
  * **Streamline** your build pipeline;
  * **ESCAPE** from configuration Samsara.
