#summary Documents the API for Escape.

= Concept =

Escape provides a RESTful interface for both the setting and getting of environment confguration. 


{{{GET}}} requests will retrive configuration, whereas {{{PUT}}} requests will set it. 

== URL scheme ==

The URL scheme is as follows:

{{{http://*Escape server name*/environments/*Environment Name*/*Application name*/*Key name*}}}

This is most easily demonstrated by deconstruction of an example URL.

{{{http://escape/environments/production/mywebapp/thiskey}}}

Will return the value of "thiskey" for the "mywebapp" application in the "production" environment. 


{{{http://escape/environments/production/mywebapp}}}

Will return all keys and values for the "mywebapp" application in the "production" environment. 


{{{http://escape/environments/production/mywebapp}}}
