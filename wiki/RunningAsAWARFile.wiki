#summary How to get Escape running as a .war file under Your Favourite Servlet Container

= Running as a .war file =

It's now possible to deploy Escape as a .war file. The API is fully working, but the UI is broken. We're working on it.

= Installation Steps =

*Note:* This has been tested on Glassfish v3, Jetty and Apache Tomcat.

 # Create an empty database for Escape in the RDBMS of your choice. I've only tested MySQL so far
 # Create a user for your database that has admin access
 # Create the .war by running _warbler_ in the source root directory
 # Copy the esc-server.war file to the webapps directory of your container.
 # Ensure the JDBC driver for your database is in the class path of your container. 
 # Create the file _~/.escape/config_ and put your JDBC connection string in there. Here's mine: 

{{{
--- 
    jdbc.url: jdbc:mysql://localhost/escape?user=escape&password=escape
