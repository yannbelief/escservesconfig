== Application ==

An application is a system that is under development. It can be of any architecture or language. 

== Environment ==

An environment is a conceptual space where a single instance of an application runs. It is completely distinct from any other environment. 

Environments could be as simple as a single desktop computer, or as complex as an entire production infrastructure that includes load-balancers, database servers, clusters of web servers _et al_. It is also possible for many environments to co-exist on a single piece of hardware.
