#summary Our plans for making Escape better.

= Features to come =

Escape is at alpha. These features will be incorporated before v1.0.

== Security ==

We are painfully aware that there is no security in Escape at v0.1. Our plans for v1.0 include:

  * Using PKI to encrypt sensitive values;
  * Using authentication to allow individuals and groups to 'own' environments and applications;
  * Access-controls to restrict the editing of un-owned values and environments.

== Client libraries ==

We haven't written a useful client library yet. But we would like to provide:

  * A DLL for .net applications, nAnt and MSBuild;
  * A jar for java applications and ant;
  * A client in a scripting language, like Python, Ruby, or Perl.
  * A client to do bulk transations on the escape database. (eg: I have moved my DB server from `fred` to `barney`, so I need to change all of my connection strings)
