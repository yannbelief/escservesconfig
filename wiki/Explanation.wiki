ESCAPE Serves Configuration Across Plentiful Environments

= Details =

This application exists to help in the development and running of custom applications. It is designed to serve environment-specific configuration to a variety of applications in a multitude of environments. 

It is particularly useful if your SDLC uses a 'build pipeline' for the promotion of code into production, but this is not a prerequisite.

<ul>
<li><b>Define</b> your environments;</li>
<li><b>Configure</b> your software;</li>
<li><b>Own</b> your configuration;</li>
<li><b>Encrypt</b> your assets;</li>
<li><b>Streamline</b> your build pipeline;</li>
<li><b>ESCAPE</b> from configuration Samsara.</li>
</ul>
