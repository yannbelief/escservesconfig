= Installation Guide =

== System Requirements ==

First off - this a Ruby app. Development and testing is done with Ruby 1.8 on OSX. We test on Ubuntu from time to time as well, especially for the database integration.

In addition to Ruby 1.8, Escape also requires the following gems:

  * ramaze (>= 2009.01)
  * rack
  * sequel (>= 2.10.0)
  * sqlite
  * json

== Getting Escape ==

The best way to get Escape is to download the zip file. Just unpack it where you want to keep it and go. If you have _rackup_ in your path, you can start the server with _./start.ru_. If not, _ruby start.rb_ should work.

Once the server is up, connect on port 7000 with your favourite browser.
