First off - this a Ruby app. Dev and tested with Ruby 1.8 on OSX.

Required ruby gems:

  * ramaze
  * rack
  * sequel
  * sqlite
  * json


If you have rackup in your path, you can start the server with './start.ru'. If not, 'ruby start.rb' will work.

Once the server is up, connect on port 7000 with your favourite browser
